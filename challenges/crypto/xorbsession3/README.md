**`Author:`** [ntnco](https://github.com/ntnco)

## Description

The flag has been xored then base64'd 10 times. I had 100 keys to choose from, so if you try them all at each step it will take you up to 1000 tries. You will never find the time to do that!!!

## Solution

Solution of the challenge can be found [here](solution/).
