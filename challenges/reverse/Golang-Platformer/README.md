## Description

Hey, check this game! You can jump with the `UpKey`, pause with the `spacebar`, slow-mo with `tab` and restart the level with `Enter`.. But can you go left?

Note: this program runs on Windows and I recommand using the IDA Freeware disassembler.

## Solution

The solution can be found [here](solution/).
