## Description

I was gonna make a long story about this challenge but it's already late in the
evening and it seemed more logical to just drop the files required to solve the
challenge.  
Seriously, who has the time to read a long challenge description? The goal is to
find the flag and submit it to the platform to earn points not to read some
randomly written description that doesn't make any sense, right?  
RIGHT?  
Like, why do people write a lot of stuff in the challenge description when they
can just go straight to the point and tell you (the player) what YOU NEED to do?
Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my time reading all those descriptions, actually,
it IS a waste of time...  
Anyway... what was this challenge about already? Ah, yes! Circuits!  
According to our sourceâ€”which shall remain nameless, a group of people developed a
new, cutting edge, hypersonic fast encryption method. How did they do it? CIRCUITS!  
But here's the thing, their implementation is weak, and if you can break it, you will
be rewarded, I promise :)

## Solution
