## Description

Can you help me find my flag? The last security guy segmented the network wayyy too much and I cannot find my way back. It should be in the home folder of one of the machines.. somewhere? You can jump from one machine to the other using SSH.

## Files

Provide the SSH key generated by the challenge.

## Solution

This problem is solvable using a DFS algorith.

1. Create a DFS crawler that will go through every node
2. To find the neighbours, you have to run the following commands:
    1. List the network interfaces using `ifconfig`.
    2. For every network interface `10.X.Y.Z/29`, find the SSH servers using `for i in $(seq Z+1 8); do timeout 1 nslookup 10.X.Y.$i; done`.
3. The flag is in one of the hosts' folder, you can find it using `grep -iR 'FLAG-' .`
