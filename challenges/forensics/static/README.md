## Description

Do not try to bend the image. That is impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth.
Then you will see that it is not the image that bends. It is only yourself.

## Solution

It is a binary embedded in an image with x and y axis inverted. Recover the RGB data, inverse it and execute it.
The encoder/decoder script of the challenge can be found [here](src/bin2img.py).
